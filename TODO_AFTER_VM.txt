- Determine if GuildedCog can basically be made with preexisting elements
  - like https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactions/api.html#discord.app_commands.guild_only

- error catching after a failing function will always send message in server
  - like sending the preexisting error message one

- investigate and this more deeply about which classes should have which functions (cause they be kinda jumbled)
- check that guild works without fetched guild and is up to date even as a variable of the class
  - probably replace with context otherwise
- change a bunch of the returns to send some error content
  - create some function that will generate this
  - figure out if there is a function that will catch errors
- move stuff that is main out to better places (espeically todos)
- use fetch guild decorator

- Figure out how to replace that with SQL database

- funny reaction if asking for my visa

- Figure out how to make a testbed for this

- talk cog for reactions to text being typed in various channels
- make another cog with some kind of polls function?
